        <h1>First steps</h1>
        <p>To begin planning your Polish wedding, start with the basics. First, decide on your budget - how much money you want to spend. Next, choose your wedding date, keeping in mind the time of year and venue availability.</p>
        <p>After setting your date, find your wedding venue, and be prepared for some flexibility. Consider how many guests you'll have, and if the location works for everyone. At the same time, start thinking about sending out "save the date" messages to your guests.</p>
        <p>These first steps are key to a smooth planning process.</p>

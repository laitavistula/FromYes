        <p>Setting the budget</p>
        <p>Planning a wedding in Poland, especially from abroad, requires a well-structured budget. Keep these key factors in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Total budget - Set a realistic amount, factoring in currency exchange rates and transaction fees.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Essential costs - Allocate funds for major expenses like the venue, catering, legal paperwork, travel, and photography.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Related costs - Plan for official translations, notarization, vendor deposits, and last-minute changes. Some payments may require cash or Polish bank transfers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Emergency fund - Unexpected expenses (e.g., weather contingencies or guest cancellations) can arise.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tip: Use a budgeting tool to track expenses and avoid surprises.</p>

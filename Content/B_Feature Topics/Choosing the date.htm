        <h1>Choosing the date</h1>
        <p>Choosing the right wedding date in Poland is not easy! You have to carefully navigate between a calendar filled with national and religious holidays, and local superstitions! Keep these in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Season &amp; availability = June, September, and October (the months with an "r" in their names in Polish) are the most popular for weddings, but also the busiest. Winter weddings may offer more affordable venues and better availability. May and November as wedding months are considered unlucky by some in Poland.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Holiday &amp; peak season considerations - Be aware of Polish holidays such as Christmas, Easter, and long weekends (e.g. May 1st-3rd, August 15th, and the long weekends around Independence Day in November) as they can affect guest and venue availability.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Weather expectations - If you're planning an outdoor ceremony, be aware of seasonal weather conditions such as rain, extreme wind, or temperatures.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Symbolic or personal significance - Choose a date that is meaningful to you and your partner.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tip: Once your date is set, book key vendors early to avoid scheduling conflicts.</p>

        <h1>The wedding day</h1>
        <h2>Overview: Timeline and schedule</h2>
        <p>Polish weddings often begin with separate morning preparations for the couple, though some choose to get ready together. The parental blessing usually takes place at the bride’s home, where close family members offer their good wishes. Makeup and hair are often done early, as Polish weddings start early in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>The ceremony, civil or religious, typically takes place in the early afternoon. In civil weddings, the couple arrives together at the registry office, while in church weddings, customs vary: some couples walk down the aisle together, while others follow the Western tradition of the father escorting the bride.</p>

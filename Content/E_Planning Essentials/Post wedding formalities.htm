        <h1>Post wedding formalities</h1>
        <h2>Marriage certificate collection</h2>
        <p>After a civil wedding, the marriage certificate (odpis aktu małżeństwa) can be collected from the Registry Office (USC) within a few days. If the marriage took place in a church, the couple must ensure the paperwork is submitted to USC for official registration. Additional copies may be needed for legal matters, including name changes.</p>
        <h2>Name change documentation</h2>
        <p>If one spouse chooses to change their last name, the declaration is made during the ceremony and reflected in the marriage certificate. Updating documents requires visits to local offices, starting with a new national ID (dowód osobisty) and passport, followed by bank records, tax offices, and insurance providers. International spouses should check specific requirements in their home countries.</p>
        <h2>Culture specifics: Thank-yous</h2>
        <p>Expressing gratitude is an important post-wedding gesture. Traditional thank-you methods include small gifts for parents and key guests, handwritten thank-you notes, or even follow-up gatherings. These thank-you gifts are often personalized with the couple’s names, wedding date, and other details, making them meaningful mementos for the recipients. In some families, it’s customary to personally deliver wedding favors (upominki ślubne) after the event. Digital thank-yous are increasingly popular, especially for international guests.</p>

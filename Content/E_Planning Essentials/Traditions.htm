        <h1>Polish wedding traditions</h1>
        <p>If you're attending or marrying into a Polish family, these traditions might come up, but they’re not obligatory by any means!</p>
        <p>You and your partner can embrace, modify, or skip them entirely, creating a wedding that celebrates your backgrounds in a way that feels right for you. Your wedding should feel personal and meaningful to you!</p>
        <h2>Pre-wedding and ceremony traditions</h2>
        <p>Traditional Polish weddings often start with a touching moment - the parental blessing. Both sets of parents wish the couple a life filled with happiness and prosperity. Once the newlyweds arrive at the reception, they are greeted by their parents again, with the traditional offering of bread and salt (chlebem i solą), symbolizing abundance. As part of the festivities, traditional customs might include the groom unveiling the bride’s face, and occasionally playful tests to check if the couple is ready for their new life together.</p>
        <h3>Reception essentials</h3>
        <p>The wedding party follows a structured schedule, typically beginning with a toast and a multi-course dinner. Oczepiny, a midnight ritual, marks the bride's transition into married life, often involving the tossing of a veil or bouquet. At traditional weddings, the night features folk-inspired dances and games, maintaining high energy well into the morning.</p>
        <h3>Poprawiny - the day after party</h3>
        <p>The day-after party, or poprawiny, is a relaxed continuation of the wedding, with additional food, drink, and casual entertainment. Attendance varies: some couples host an open-invitation gathering, while others keep it intimate. Modern couples may skip the poprawiny altogether or opt for a brunch-style alternative.</p>
        <h3>Regional and family expectations</h3>
        <p>Poland's diverse regions influence wedding customs, from vodka rituals in the east to góralskie (highlander) traditions in the south. Family involvement can be extensive, with parents and elders playing key roles in organizing and hosting. Alcohol flows freely, often with special toasts, and guests typically pace themselves for an extended celebration.</p>

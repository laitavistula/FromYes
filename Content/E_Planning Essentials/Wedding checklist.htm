        <h1>Wedding checklist</h1>
        <p>The following checklist outlines the key legal and administrative steps to help you successfully navigate your wedding preparations.

</p>
        <h2>Core steps:
</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;">□ <strong>Determine marriage type</strong>: decide on the type of ceremony (civil, church, concordat, ecumenical, humanist) as this dictates the required paperwork.

</p>
        <p>□ <strong>Gather required documents</strong>: collect all necessary documents (ID, birth certificates, proof of previous marriage termination, etc.).</p>
        <p>□ <strong>Translate and authenticate</strong>: if any documents are foreign, ensure they are translated by a sworn translator (tłumacz przysięgły) and authenticated with an Apostille (if applicable).</p>
        <p>

□ <strong>Apply at the USC</strong>: submit the application and required documents to the local <strong>Register Office</strong> (<em>Urząd Stanu Cywilnego, USC</em>).</p>
        <p>□ <strong>
Fulfill the waiting period</strong>: be aware of the one-month waiting period after submitting the application before the marriage can take place.

</p>
        <p>□ <strong>Attend the ceremony</strong>: hold the wedding ceremony according to the chosen type (civil, church, etc.).</p>
        <p>□ 
<strong>Register your marriage</strong>: ensure the marriage is officially registered (especially important for church or humanist ceremonies).</p>
        <p>
            <br />
        </p>
        <h2>Highly recommended:
</h2>
        <p>□ <strong>Contact your embassy (for international couples):</strong> international couples should contact their embassy for specific guidance on legal requirements and documentation.</p>
        <p>□ <strong>Plan for name change (if applicable):</strong> if either spouse plans to change their name, understand the necessary procedures and documentation. &#160;<br /><br /><a href="../Resources/PDFs/SY_Wedding checklist.pdf#Wedding%20checklist%20PDF" alt="PDF version of the wedding checklist" title="PDF version of the wedding checklist" target="_blank">SY_Wedding checklist.pdf</a></p>

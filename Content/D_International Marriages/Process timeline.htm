        <h3>Pre-marriage (Start 6+ months in advance)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Foreigners must submit their documents (e.g., birth certificates, proof of identity, marital status confirmation) for translation and authentication.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Post-marriage - registration:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Once the ceremony is completed, the international couple must register their marriage with the local USC.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Last name decisions</h1>
        <p>In Poland, while it is common for one spouse to adopt the other's surname after marriage, this is not a mandatory requirement. Couples have several legally recognized options regarding surname choices.
</p>
        <h2>Surname options</h2>
        <p>Couples may choose from the following surname options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Adoption:</strong> one spouse adopts the other spouse's surname.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Retention:</strong> both spouses retain their respective pre-marriage surnames.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Combination:</strong> both spouses' surnames are combined to form a double-barreled surname. This combined surname can be taken by one or both spouses.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
Legal framework</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Any desired surname changes must be formally requested and registered at the <strong>Registry office</strong> (<em>Urząd Stanu Cywilnego, USC</em>) at the time of marriage registration.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Upon processing a name change request, the registry office will issue new official documents reflecting the chosen surname(s).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Children's surnames</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Spouses can also specify the surname(s) of their future children during the marriage registration process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If no explicit decision is made regarding children's surnames, children will automatically receive a double-barreled surname upon birth registration.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

                <p>Delays in paperwork are not uncommon, particularly for international couples. </p>
                <p>If key documents are delayed (such as the marriage certificate or translations), contact the relevant Registry Office (USC) or your embassy for guidance.</p>
                <p>Having a backup marriage date in case of unexpected delays can save stress.</p>
                <p>Working with a local translator or legal expert can fast-track the process.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Translation issues can arise if a document is incorrectly translated or lacks necessary certification.</p>
                <p>Ensure all translations are handled by sworn translators (<em>tłumacz przysięgły</em>), recognized by the government.</p>
                <p>If something goes wrong, have additional copies of the translations ready to submit.</p>
                <p>For last-minute issues, check if the wedding venue or local authorities accept informal translations or if a notary can verify the documents.</p>

                        <p><strong>Outdoor Venue Backup:</strong> For weddings scheduled outdoors, a designated indoor contingency venue is essential to accommodate adverse weather conditions, including rain or unseasonably cold temperatures.</p>

                </ul>

                        <p><strong>Guest Preparedness:</strong> Advise guests to prepare for potential weather variations. Recommend umbrellas and raincoats, especially during spring and summer months where sudden showers are common. For summer weddings, inform guests about the possibility of high temperatures.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Winter Travel Advisory:</strong> Guests planning to drive to Poland for a winter wedding should be aware that while winter tires are not legally mandated, their use is strongly recommended for safety between November 1st and April 1st due to potential icy or snowy road conditions.</p>

        <h1>Witnesses</h1>
        <p>At any wedding ceremony in Poland, two witnesses are required. Each witness must be at least 18 years old.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Civil and Concordat Weddings</strong>:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>
                        <p>Witnesses must have a valid identification document (e.g., national ID or passport).</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Church Weddings</strong>:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>
                        <p>While tradition suggests choosing religious witnesses of different genders as role models for the couple, this is not a strict requirement.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Witnesses must be at least 18 years old and have valid identification.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Witnesses, along with the couple, will sign the marriage certificate, typically in the sacristy before the ceremony.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>It is traditional for witnesses to be able to participate in confession and communion, but it's not mandatory.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Witnesses do not need to be of the same denomination as the church of the wedding or have received confirmation.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Humanist Weddings</strong>:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>
                        <p>Witnesses are not legally required at the actual ceremony, as the couple signs the marriage certificate at the civil ceremony at the <strong>Register office</strong> (<em>Urząd Stanu Cywilnego, USC</em>). However, couples may choose to have witnesses for symbolic purposes.</p>

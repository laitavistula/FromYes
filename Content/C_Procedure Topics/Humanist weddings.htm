        <h1>Humanist weddings</h1>
        <p>A humanist wedding is a non-religious ceremony offering personalized vows and rituals. It is symbolic, and a legal civil marriage must occur before or after the humanist ceremony.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Complete the civil marriage process at the registry office before or after the humanist ceremony.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Humanist ceremonies are customizable and can take place at various locations.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The celebrant does not register the marriage; legal formalities must be handled separately.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

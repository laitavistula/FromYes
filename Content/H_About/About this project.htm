        <h1>About this project</h1>
        <p>“From 'Yes' to Wesele" is a comprehensive, non-commercial guide designed to assist foreign nationals marrying in Poland. It aims to clarify the necessary procedures, paperwork, and tasks, offering insights into Polish wedding venues and customs, practical tips on logistics, and ultimately providing international couples with a valuable resource for planning their special day.</p>
        <p>This project showcases that the principles of technical communication can be applied to a broad spectrum of topics, extending well beyond traditionally "technical" subjects. While technical writing is usually associated with documenting software or machinery, this guide demonstrates its value in clarifying complex processes in other areas of life.</p>

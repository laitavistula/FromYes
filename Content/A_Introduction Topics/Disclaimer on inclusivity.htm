        <h1>Disclaimer on inclusivity</h1>
        <p>The current Polish legal framework defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman of legal marriageable age (18), neither of whom is currently married and who are not related. Poland recognizes civil ceremonies performed by state officials, religious ceremonies with civil effects, and qualified international marriages. While legal marriage options are limited, couples can arrange symbolic ceremonies, commitment ceremonies, or private reception events. Many wedding service providers, including venues, caterers, and event planners, accommodate a variety of celebrations and support diverse couples.</p>
